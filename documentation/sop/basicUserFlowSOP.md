## Implementation Steps


!!! Consider that we are using Next.js App Router!!!
!!! Use the correct colors, fonts and classes from globals.css!!!
!!! Use tailwind css for styling and responsiveness!!!

1. Create the layout component:
   - Create `src/app/layout.tsx`.
   - Implement a full-screen layout with fixed header, flexible content area, and footer.
   - Use Flexbox or Grid to ensure proper spacing and responsiveness.

2. Implement the Header component:
   - Create `src/components/Header.tsx`.
   - Add "QuickType" on the left, "Training" link in the middle, and profile link on the right.
   - Ensure the header takes up only as much space as its content requires.
   - Use the correct colors, fonts and classes from globals.css
   - Use tailwind css for styling and responsiveness

3. Implement the Footer component:
   - Create `src/components/Footer.tsx`.
   - Add links to Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and Contact Us.
   - Ensure the footer fills the remaining screen space along with the content area.
   - Use the correct colors, fonts and classes from globals.css
   - Use tailwind css for styling and responsiveness

4. Create pages:
   - Implement `src/app/page.tsx` as the landing page.
   - Create `src/app/profile/page.tsx` for the user profile page.
   - Create `src/app/training/page.tsx` for the training page.
